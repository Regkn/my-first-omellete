        <h3>Preparation time</h3>
        <p><b>Total:</b> Approximately 10 minutes</p>
        <p><b>Preparation:</b> 5 mintues</p>
        <p><b>Cooking:</b> 5 mintues</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <pre>
            2-3 large eggs
            Salt, to taste
            Pepper, to taste
            1 tablespoon of butter or optional
            Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, hearbs
        </pre>


        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <pre>            Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
            You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
          
            Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
          
            Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
            the eggs evenly coat the surface.
          
            Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
            middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
          
            Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
          
            Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</pre>
